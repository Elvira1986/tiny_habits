      <ul>
        According to Dr. BJ Fogg, 3 key things need to come together for a
        behavior to happen:
        <li>
          <i className="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Motivation
        </li>
        <li>
          <i className="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Ability
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          <i className="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Prompt
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How About 21 Day Myth?</h3>
      <p>
        There is a popular idea out that it takes 21 days to make a habit.
        Assuming you engage the new behavior every day, a three-week commitment
        seems pretty manageable. Unfortunately, there are too many unknown
        variables, like how hard is the habit and what you have do to achieve.
        It is simply an incalculable equation, but we are here to help you to
        stay on habit journey motivated and keep it track.
