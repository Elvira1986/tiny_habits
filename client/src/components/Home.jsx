        Change your life for good with the Tiny Habits method—where simple
        changes lead to real, life-changing results. It's easier than you think,
        surprisingly fun, and designed for real-world success. <br />
        Remember, no behavior happens without a prompt. Once you’ve identified
        which tiny behavior you want to introduce into your life, you need to
        find a good prompt to remind you to do it. You can tie this prompt to
        yourself (some kind of internal emotional or physical cue), your
        context, or an action in a pre-existing routine. Action-based prompts
        are special in Tiny Habits. They’re called Anchors.
